"""
Regression tests for prune_nested_refs() with more than one top-level Device.

Background: prune_nested_refs() previously assumed a single top-level Device
and rewrote every nested Interface/IPAddress device-ref to that device's
matcher stub. With future multi-Device translator paths (switch stacks /
Virtual Chassis), each nested ref must be rewritten to ITS OWN device's
stub, not "the first device in the list".
