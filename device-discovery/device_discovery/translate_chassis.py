"""
Translate switch-stack / NetBox VirtualChassis payloads.

Consumed by ``device_discovery.translate.translate_data`` when a NAPALM driver
returns a ``chassis_members`` payload via the optional ``get_chassis_members()``
method (see ``custom_napalm/_chassis.py``).

Emission shape, in order:

  1. Master ``Device`` (PLAIN — no ``vc_position``, no ``virtual_chassis`` ref)
  2. Top-level ``VirtualChassis`` with an inline non-recursive master ref
  3. N - 1 non-master member ``Device`` entities, each carrying ``vc_position``
     and an inline ``virtual_chassis`` whose master is the same matcher block
     (also non-recursive)
  4. ``Interface`` / ``IPAddress`` entities, each routed to the correct member
     by ``parse_member_id``.

Logical master is pinned to the lowest member id so live StackWise role
failovers do not change the VC's master Device on re-runs (Diode resolves
existing VCs via the ``unique_master`` matcher).
